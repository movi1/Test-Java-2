                    <p>
                        Welcome to my new website, where I will be sharing my thoughts and experiences on various
                        aspects of life.
                        From my new career in coding to my love for art and fitness.
                        I will be sharing my insights and tips on how to live a fulfilling and balanced life.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I am a junior developer with a passion for creating user-friendly and engaging experiences
                        through front-end web development.
                        My skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Bootstrap, SQL, and Git version control.
                        I am always eager to learn and improve my skills.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to my passion for web development, I also have a love for fitness and wellness.
                        I enjoy weightlifting and practicing yoga to stay physically and mentally healthy.
                        I believe that having a healthy balance between work and personal life is important for success.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I have also gained experience in various other fields such as freelancing as a software
                        developer,
                        caregiving for my children, working as a barista, dental assistant, and set designer.
                        I am fluent in English and Italian, and I have completed a number of online courses and
                        bootcamps to enhance my abilities.
                    </p>
